This Master's Thesis proposes the study and implementation of Deep Learning algorithms in order to detect abandoned objects in video surveillance applications.

A theoretical study of the detection and monitoring algorithms available in the State of the Art has been carried out. YOLOv4 \cite{bochkovskiy2020yolov4} has been used to detect objects in real time. DeepSORT \cite{Wojke2017simple} has been chosen as tracking algorithm. Finally, an algorithm has been developed to determine when an object has been abandoned or not. All of them have been implemented on the MS COCO \cite{lin2015microsoft} benchmark dataset and evaluated on the most relevant datasets in the detection of abandoned objects such as GBA2018 \cite{gba-dataset}, PETS2007 \cite{pets2007-dataset} or AVSSAB2007 \cite{AVSSAB2007-dataset}.
