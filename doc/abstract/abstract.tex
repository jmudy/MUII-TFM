The aim of this Master's Thesis is to study and implement algorithms using convolutional neural networks (\textit{CNN}) in order to detect abandoned objects through the use of video surveillance applications. These networks are specialized supervised learning algorithms for working with images (put DotCSV explanation).

In the present document, has been carried out a theoretical study of the different object detection algorithms on certain databases, as well as tracking algorithms available in the State of the Art. YOLOv4 \cite{bochkovskiy2020yolov4} has been used for object detection. Subsequently, a DeepSORT algorithm \cite{Wojke2017simple} has been developed where it has been filtered that only tracks people and objects of interest: backpacks, suitcases and handbags. COCO \cite{lin2015microsoft} has been used as the dataset as standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of computer vision models.

Finally, an algorithm has been implemented and evaluated to determine whether an object has been abandoned or not. To do this, different metrics must be taken into account, such as the time that the object is static at a certain point or the distance it is from the person who was carrying it.
